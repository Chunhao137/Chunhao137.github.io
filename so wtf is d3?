so wtf is d3?

something about enter, update, and modifying keys... think it has something to do with how these things move.

general update pat 1
- data join is followed by operations on enter, update, and exit
- if no key is present, so entering elements always occur at the end
- if theres more new data coming in than old, new elemnts are entered

general update pat 2
- adding a key means that you can enter new elements on top of the key value
- the key seems to be the index within the array for the new elements to enter
- text content needs updating on enter because mapping from letter to element never changes?
- x position of the text element must be recomputed on update as well as enter

general update pat 3
- transitions (animations) are defined for enter, updated, and exited.
- merged enter + update doesn't have two transitions, because these would supercede the transition already scheduled on entering and updating.
- concurrent transitions are possible, but i think you would need to define y yourself. x is defined 'statically'

thinking with joins
-d3 has no primitive for creating multiple dom elements
-you can use append
- ex to try
  svg.append('circle')
    .attr('cx', d.x)
    .attr('cy', d.y)
    .attr('r', 2.5)
